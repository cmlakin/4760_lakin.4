Simulated Operating System

What went well:
	-I learned a lot about what not to do. 
	-I saw how it really helps to not only use make to check for errors, but to also run the program to
	see if it is performing something the way that it should. 
	-I learned my lesson from last time of not trying to do too much between running the program to see
	if it is working so you can see what is going wrong
	- I am not sure if breaking this a part into so many functions is more helpful. It is definitely 
	easier to follow along, at times. But then sometimes I still get a little lost. 

Struggles:
	My biggest struggle this time was time management. I let myself take a few days off after the last 
	project thinking I would still have enough time to work through everything. Then a lot of stuff 
	came up where I need to be more of a mom than a student and I can't pull all nighters like when I 
	was younger. And this just does not give me enough time in a day. 

	I let myself get too stressed out and would spend too much time trying to figure something out that
	wasn't working by myself than asking for help. I feel like this should not feel as hard as it does
	right now to figure some of this out. And I am a bad googler. I'm not good at wording what it is I
	am looking for and spend too much time trying to find something that makes sense or is similar to
	what I am trying to do. And after typing that I wonder if that should be a sign that maybe I need to 
	rethink how I am doing things.
