Project 4

Simulated Operating System

Problem running: It will go into an endless loop of the active process count. 
	It was doing this in my system and I fixed it, but not sure why it is 
	doing it again in here. I copied all of my files over. Not sure what is
	going on with it. 

	I did not get to the report. I started to do it but then had other debugging
	that took priority. 

Algorithm:
	Type Choice:
		IO 30%
		CPU 70%

	Operation Choice:
		TERMINATE 10% Chance for CPU or IO
		BLOCK 
			if CPU 30% chance
			if IO 60% chance
		USE ALL
			if IO 30% chance
			if CPU 60% chance

What went well:
	-I learned a lot about what not to do. 
	-I saw how it really helps to not only use make to check for errors, 
		but to also run the program to see if it is performing something 
		the way that it should. 
	-I learned my lesson from last time of not trying to do too much 
		between running the program to see if it is working so you can 
		see what is going wrong
	- I am not sure if breaking this a part into so many functions is 
		more helpful. It is definitely easier to follow along, at times. 
		But then sometimes I still get a little lost. 
	- I am understanding a lot more about how the queues work, signal
		handling, and now using bits. 

Struggles:
	My biggest struggle this time was time management. I let myself take 
	a few days off after the last project and then when trying to focus 
	on this, life got in the way. As the semester goes on it becomes more
	difficult to juggle school, work, and family. Especially when family
	has become more demanding of my time. 

	Since we were given more time, I spent time with the tutor expalaining
	alot of stuff I may not have necessarily needed for this project. Now
	we are down to the day of and I'm still running into problems. I 
	probably should have just gotten it all working and then went back to
	make enhancements rather than trying to do them along the way. 

	I struggled at first when he kept telling me to separate things out 
	more, but am getting used to it. It does help with debugging and finding
	where the code is at rather than having to scroll through lines and 
	lines of code every time.

	I started working in my own terminal so I wouldn't have to log in every
	time, and tried to make sure to transfer the files and make pushes to
	gitHub. As time went on, I didn't do that as often as I should have.
	I found myself not remembering exactly everything that I had worked on
	or changed. Will be more mindful of this next time. 

	It also helps to transfer the files over before pushing.
